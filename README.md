## Case & Mounting

* The case is **fully 3D‑printed** 
* Heat‑set inserts are installed into the case for durability
* PCB is mounted directly to the case 

Ensure heat‑set inserts are installed carefully using a soldering iron tip sized for M3 inserts.

## Assembly Notes

1. Solder all components to the PCB
2. Place the PCB in the case and screw the top plate
3. Attach keycaps

## Firmware

* I used KMK for this project, but ill improve it when i get the hackpad
  
---

Perfect for:

* Coding shortcuts
* CAD 
* Learning keyboard firmware
